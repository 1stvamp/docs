<section id="charm-hooks">
<h1>Charm hooks</h1>

<p>A service unit's direct action is entirely defined by its charm's hooks. Hooks
are executable files in a charm's <code>hooks</code> directory; hooks with particular
names (see below) will be invoked by the juju unit agent at particular times, and thereby cause
changes to the world.</p>

<p>Whenever a hook-worthy event takes place, the unit agent first checks whether
that hook is being <a href="./authors-hook-debug.html">debugged</a>, and if so
hands over control to the user. Otherwise, it tries to find a hook with precisely
the right name. If the hook doesn't exist, the agent continues without complaint;
if it does, it is invoked without arguments in a specific
<a href="./authors-hook-environment.html">environment</a>, and its output is written
to the unit agent's log. If it returns a non-zero exit code, the agent enters an
<a href="./authors-hook-errors.html">error state</a> and awaits user intervention.</p>

<p>The agent will also enter an error state if the unit agent process is aborted
during hook execution.</p>

<p>There are two types of hooks, described in more detail in the following sections.</p>

<p class = "note"><strong>Note: </strong>None of the unit or relation hooks are required; if you don't implement a hook,
it just doesn't get run. When a hook event occurs, Juju will look for the corresponding hook file to execute, but if it finds none, will continue running without generating an error.</p>
</section>

<section id="unit-hooks">
<h2>Unit hooks</h2>

<p>There are 5 &quot;unit hooks&quot; with predefined names that can be implemented
by any charm:</p>
<ul>
    <li>install</li>
    <li>config-changed</li>
    <li>start</li>
    <li>upgrade-charm</li>
    <li>stop</li>
</ul>

<p>For every relation defined by a charm, an additional 4 &quot;relation hooks&quot;
can be implemented, named after the charm relation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;name&gt;-relation-joined</li>
  <li>&lt;name&gt;-relation-changed</li>
  <li>&lt;name&gt;-relation-departed</li>
  <li>&lt;name&gt;-relation-broken</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the unit or relation hooks are required; if you don't implement a hook,
it just doesn't get run, except when debugging. When a hook event occurs, Juju will 
look for the corresponding hook file to execute, but if it finds none, will continue 
running without generating an error.</p>

<p>The unit hooks are run under the following circumstances.</p>
</section>

<section id="hook-install">
<h3>install</h3>

<p><code>install</code> runs just once, before any other hook. It should be used to
perform one-time setup operations only.</p>
</section>

<section id="hook-config-changed">
<h3>config-changed</h3>

<p><code>config-changed</code> runs in several different situations.</p>
<ul>
    <li>immediately after "install"</li>
    <li>immediately after "upgrade-charm"</li>
    <li>at least once when the unit agent is restarted (but, if the unit is in
    an <a href="./authors-hook-errors.html">error state</a>, it won't be run
    until after the error state is cleared).</li>
</ul>
<p>It cannot assume that the software has already been started; it should not
start stopped software, but should (if appropriate) restart running software
to take configuration changes into account.</p>
</section>

<section id="hook-start">
<h3>start</h3>
<p><code>start</code> runs immediately after the first <code>config-changed</code>
hook. It should be used to ensure the charm's software is running. Note that the
charm's software should be configured so as to persist through reboots without further
intervention on juju's part.
</section>

<section id="hook-upgrade-charm">
<h3>upgrade-charm</h3>

<p><code>upgrade-charm</code> runs immediately after any
<a href="./authors-charm-upgrades.html">upgrade</a> operation that does <em>not</em>
itself interrupt an existing <a href="./authors-hook-errors.html">error state.</a>. It
should be used to reconcile local state written by some other version of the charm into
whatever form it needs to take to be manipulated by the current version.</p>

<p>While the forced upgrade functionality is intended as a developer tool, and is
not generally suitable for end users, it's somewhat optimistic to depend on the
functionality never being abused. In light of this, if you need to run an
<code>upgrade-charm</code> hook before your other hooks will work correctly,
it may be wise to preface all your other hooks with a quick call to your
(idempotent)<code>upgrade-charm</code>.</p>
</section>

<section id="hook-stop">
<h3>stop</h3>

<p><code>stop</code> runs immediately before the end of the unit's destruction
sequence. It should be used to ensure that the charm's software is not running, and
will not start again on reboot.</p>
</section>

<section id="relation-hooks">
<h2>Relation hooks</h2>

<p>Units will only participate in relations after they're been started, and before
they've been stopped. Within that time window, the unit may participate in several
different relations at a time, <em>including</em> multiple relations with the
same name.</p>

<p>To illustrate, consider a database service that will be used by multiple client
services. Units of a single client service will surely want to connect to, and
use, the same database; but if units of another client service were to use that
same database, the consequences could be catastrophic for all concerned.</p>

<p>If juju respected the <code>limit</code> field in relation
<a href="./authors-charm-metadata.html">metadata</a>, it would be possible
to work around this, but it's not a high-priority
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1089297">bug</a>: most provider services
<em>should</em> be able to handle multiple requirers anyway; and most requirers will
only be connected to one provider anyway.</p>

<p>When a unit running a given charm participates in a given relation, it runs at
least three hooks for every remote unit it becomes aware of in that relation.</p>
</section>

<section id="hook-relation-joined">
<h3>&lt;name&gt;-relation-joined</h3>

<p><code>&lt;name&gt;-relation-joined</code> is run once only, when that remote
unit is first observed by the unit. It should be used to <code>relation-set</code> any
local unit settings that can be determined using no more than the name of the joining
unit and the remote <code>private-address</code> setting, which is always available
when the relation is created and is by convention not deleted.</p>

<p>You should not depend upon any other relation settings in the -joined hook
because they're not guaranteed to be present; if you need more information
you should wait for a -changed hook that presents the right information.</p>
</section>

<section id="hook-relation-changed">
<h3>&lt;name&gt;-relation-changed</h3>

<p><code>&lt;name&gt;-relation-changed</code> is always run once, after -joined, and
will subsequently be run whenever that remote unit changes its settings for the
relation. It should be the <em>only</em> hook that <em>relies</em> upon remote relation
settings from <code>relation-get</code>, and it should <em>not</em> error if the
settings are incomplete: you can guarantee that when the remote unit changes its
settings, the hook will be run again.</p>

<p>The settings that you can get, and that you should set, are determined by
the relation's <a href="./authors-charm-interfaces.html">interface</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="hook-relation-departed">
<h3>&lt;name&gt;-relation-departed</h3>

<p><code>&lt;name&gt;-relation-departed</code> is run once only, when the remote unit
is known to be leaving the relation; it will only run once at least one -changed has
been run, and after -departed has run, no further -changeds will be run. This should
be used to remove all references to the remote unit, because there's no guarantee that
it's still part of the system; it's perfectly probable (although not guaranteed) that
the system running that unit has already shut down.</p>

<p>When a unit's own participation in a relation is known to be ending, the unit
agent continues to uphold the ordering guarantees above; but within those
constraints, it will run the fewest possible hooks to notify the charm of the
departure of each individual remote unit.</p>

<p>Once all necessary -departed hooks have been run for such a relation, the unit
agent will run the final relation hook:</p>
</section>

<section id="hook-relation-broken">
<h3>&lt;name&gt;-relation-broken</h3>

<p><code>&lt;name&gt;-relation-broken</code> indicates that the current relation is
no longer valid, and that the charm's software must be configured as though the
relation had never existed. It will only be called after every necessary -departed
hook has been run; if it's being executed, you can be sure that no remote units are
currently known locally.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the -broken hook might run even if no other units
have ever joined the relation. This is not a bug: even if no remote units have ever
joined, the fact of the unit's participation can be detected in other hooks via the
<code>relation-ids</code> tool, and the -broken hook needs to execute to give the
charm an opportunity to clean up any optimistically-generated configuration.</p>

<p>And, again, it's important to internalise the fact that there may be multiple
runtime relations in play with the same name, and that they're independent:
one -broken hook does not mean that <em>every</em> such relation is broken.</p>
</section>

<section id="writing-hooks">
<h2>Writing hooks</h2>

<p>If you follow the <a href="./authors-charm-writing.html">tutorial</a>, you'll
get a good sense of the basics. To fill out your knowledge, you'll want to study
the hook <a href="./authors-hook-environment.html">environment and tools</a>, and
to experiment with <a href="./authors-hook-debug.html">debug-hooks</a>.</p>

<p>Independent of the nuts and bolts, though, good hooks display a number of
useful high-level properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They are <em>idempotent</em>: that is to say that there should be no
    observable difference between running a hook once, and running it N times
    in a row. If this property does not hold, you are likely to be making your
    own life unnecesarily difficult: apart from anything else, the average user's
    most likely first response to a failed hook will be to try to run it again
    (if they don't just skip it).</li>

    <li>They are <em>easy to read</em> and understand. It's tempting to write a
    single file that does everything, and which just calls different functions
    internally depending on the value of <code>argv[0]</code>, and to symlink that
    one file for every hook; but such structures quickly become unwieldy.<br />
    The time taken to write a library, separate from the hooks, is very likely
    to be well spent: it lets you write single hooks that are clear and focused,
    and insulates the maintainer from irrelevant details.</li>

    <li>Where possible, they reuse
    <a href="https://launchpad.net/charm-tools">common code</a> already written to
    ease or solve common use cases.</li>

    <li>They do not return <a href="./authors-hook-errors.html">errors</a> unless
    there is a good reason to believe that they cannot be resolved without user
    intervention. Doing so is an admission of defeat: a user who sees your charm
    returning an error state is unlikely to have the specific expertise necessary
    to resolve it. If you have to return an error, please be sure to at least write
    any context you can to the log before you do so.</li>

    <li>They write only <em>very</em> sparingly to the
    <a href="./authors-charm-components.html">charm directory</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We recommend you also familiarize yourself with the
<a href="./authors-charm-best-practice.html">best practices</a> and, if you
plan to distribute your charm, the
<a href="./authors-charm-policy.html">charm store policy</a>.</p>
