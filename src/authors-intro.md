# Becoming a charm author

Juju makes deploying cloud services spectacularly easy. One of the key
components of the Juju ecosystem that makes this possible is the wealth of
quality, reliable charms enabling users to quickly and reliably deploy all sorts
of software, from simple web-based forums to a complete OpenStack install.

There are however times when the particular service you want to use doesn't have
a charm available - maybe it is your own project? Or perhaps the existing charm
for a service doesn't work in precisely the way you want. Whatever your reasons
for writing a charm, this section of the documentation will guide you through
the process. You might want to start by looking at [what makes a charm](authors-
charm-components.html), which breaks down and explains the different components
that go into making a charm. Or you may want to dive right in with the
[walkthrough for writing an example charm](authors-charm-writing.html).
