# Introducing Charms

The magic behind Juju is a collection of software components called charms.
They contain all the instructions necessary for deploying and configuring
cloud-based services. The charms publicly available in the online
[Charm Store](authors-charm-store.html) represent the distilled DevOps knowledge
of experts. If you cannot find what you're looking for or if what's available
does not suit your needs then you are free to write your own.

Charms make it quick and easy to reliably and repeatedly deploy services in
your cloud. If you haven't already tried the
[Juju walkthrough](/docs/getting-started.html), you should give it a go and see
how easy it is to deploy services in minutes.

In many cases, you will simply deploy, configure and expose services in your
cloud. The following sections explore in more detail the everyday Juju and Charm
operations you are likely to perform.
