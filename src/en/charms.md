# Introducing Charms

The magic behind Juju is a collection of software components called charms.
These are the encapsulated knowledge of how to properly deploy and configure the
services you will want to deploy on your cloud. The charms available online in
the [Charm Store](/docs/authors-charm-store.html) represent the distilled DevOps
knowledge of experts, and they are freely available for you to use (or you can
write your own).

Charms make it quick and easy to reliably and repeatedly deploy services in your
cloud. If you haven't already tried the [Juju walkthrough](/docs/getting-
started.html), you should give it a go and see how ridiculously easy it is to
deploy services in minutes.

In many cases, you will simply deploy, configure and expose services in your
cloud. The following sections explore in more detail the everyday Juju and Charm
operations you are likely to perform

  - [Configuring Services](charms-config.html)
  - [Managing Relationships](charms-relations.html)
  - [Using Constraints](charms-constraints.html)
