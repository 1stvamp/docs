# Environment Variables

## Juju Client

These variables are available on the juju client in order to change its default behavior.

- JUJU_ENV

    Juju has three ways it will check, in descending order, to determine the current environment:

    1. Check to see if <code>JUJU_ENV</code> is set.

```no-highlight
JUJU_ENV=local
```

    2. Read <code>$JUJU_HOME/current-environment</code>, which is set by <code>juju switch $environment</code>
    3. Read <code>$JUJU_HOME/environments.yaml</code> and use the default environment.


- JUJU_HOME

    The path to juju's configuration files.

```no-highlight
JUJU_HOME=~/.juju
```

- JUJU_REPOSITORY

    This allows you to set the repository that Juju looks for charms in. This can also be done by passing <code>--repository=/path/to/charms</code> when executing <code>juju deploy</code>.

    For example, if you are running juju in a Vagrant  virtual machine, you could set <code>JUJU_REPOSITORY</code> to your shared folder:

```bash
export JUJU_REPOSITORY=/vagrant
juju deploy local:series/charm
```

- JUJU_LOGGING_CONFIG

    This setting takes effect on an environment only at bootstrap time. In stable Juju releases, agents are started with logging set to WARNING, and units are set to INFO. Development releases are set to DEBUG globally. Post bootstrap, on a running environment you can change the logging options to be more or less verbose. For example:

```bash
juju set-environment logging-config "juju=DEBUG; unit=WARNING"
```

# Unit

These variables are available to charms during hook execution.

- JUJU_API_ADDRESSES

    A space-separated list of API servers.

```no-highlight
JUJU_API_ADDRESSES="10.0.3.1:17070"
```

- JUJU_AGENT_SOCKET

    The socket that the Unit Agent uses to communicate with individual Units.

```no-highlight
JUJU_AGENT_SOCKET="@/var/lib/juju/agents/unit-postgresql-0/agent.socket"
```

- JUJU_CONTEXT_ID

    Used by juju to communicate to ask a running agent to execute a command on juju's behalf.

```no-highlight
JUJU_CONTEXT_ID="postgresql/0:db-relation-joined:34317605475203611"
```

- JUJU_DEBUG

    The temporary directory where <code>juju debug-hooks</code> is spawned from.

```no-highlight
JUJU_DEBUG="/tmp/tmp.vGQlc2bTcV"
```

    The human-friendly name of the current environment.

```no-highlight
