# Environment Variables

- JUJU_AGENT_SOCKET

    The socket that Unit Agent uses to communicate with Units.

- JUJU_API_ADDRESSES

    A space-separated list of API servers.

- JUJU_CONTAINER_TYPE

    Used by MAAS to find the address of a machine.

- JUJU_CONTEXT_ID

    Used by juju to communicate to ask a running agent to execute a command on juju's behalf.

- JUJU_DEBUG

    The temporary directory where <code>juju debug-hooks</code> is spawned from.

- JUJU_DUMMY_DELAY

    A delay to operations in the dummy provider environment. This can be set by setting <code>JUJU_DUMMY_DELAY</code> to a [time.Duration](http://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration) parsable value.

- JUJU_ENV

    Juju has three ways it will check, in descending order, to determine the current environment:

    1. Check to see if <code>JUJU_ENV</code> is set.
    2. Read <code>$JUJU_HOME/current-environment</code>, which is set by <code>juju switch $environment</code>
    3. Read <code>$JUJU_HOME/environments.yaml</code> and use the default environment.


- JUJU_ENV_NAME

    The human-friendly name of the current environment.

- JUJU_ENV_UUID

    The unique identifier of the juju environment.

- JUJU_HOME

    The path to juju's configuration files.

    Default: <code>~/.juju</code>

- JUJU_HOOK_NAME

    The name of the hook being executed.

- JUJU_LOGGING_CONFIG

    All agents are started with all logging set to DEBUG. You can change the logging options to be more or less verbose. For example:

        juju set-environment logging-config "juju=WARNING; unit=INFO"

- JUJU_NOTEST_MONGOJS

    Some tests assume a MongoDB instance that supports Javascript for map-reduce functions. These functions are not supported by juju-mongodb and will fail unless <code>JUJU_NOTEST_MONGOJS</code> is defined:
        JUJU_NOTEST_MONGOJS=1 go test launchpad.net/juju-core/...

- JUJU_RELATION

    The relation name being executed.

- JUJU_RELATION_ID

    The ID of the relation being executed.

- JUJU_REMOTE_UNIT

    The name of the current related unit.

- JUJU_REPOSITORY

    This allows you to set the repository that Juju looks for charms in. This can also be done by passing <code>--repository=/path/to/charms</code> when executing <code>juju deploy</code>.

    For example, if you are running juju in a Vagrant  virtual machine, you could set <code>JUJU-RELATION</code> to your shared folder:

        export JUJU_RELATION=/vagrant
        juju deploy local:series/charm

- JUJU_UNIT_NAME

    The name of the local unit being executed.
